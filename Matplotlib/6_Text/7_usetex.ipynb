    "Matplotlib can use LaTeX to render text.  This is activated by setting\n",
    "``text.usetex : True`` in your rcParams, or by setting the ``usetex`` property\n",
    "to True on individual `.Text` objects.  Text handling through LaTeX is slower\n",
    "than Matplotlib's very capable `mathtext <mathtext>`, but\n",
    "is more flexible, since different LaTeX packages (font packages, math packages,\n",
    "etc.) can be used. The results can be striking, especially when you take care\n",
    "to use the same fonts in your figures as in the main document.\n",

    "and SVG backends, if LuaTeX is present, it will be used to speed up some\n",

    "users, because the text is coarsely rasterized and converted to bitmaps, which\n",
    "are not scalable like standard PostScript, and the text is not searchable. One\n",
    "workaround is to set :rc:`ps.distiller.res` to a higher value (perhaps 6000)\n",
    "in your rc settings, which will produce larger files but may look better and\n",
    "scale reasonably. A better workaround, which requires Poppler_ or Xpdf_, can\n",
    "be activated by changing :rc:`ps.usedistiller` to ``xpdf``. This alternative\n",
