    "This routine simply adds the elements in two contiguous arrays and places the result in a third. The memory for all three arrays must be provided by the calling routine. A very basic interface to this routine can be automatically generated by f2py:\n",
    "\n",
    "python -m numpy.f2py -m add add.f\n",
    "This command will produce an extension module named addmodule.c in the current directory. This extension module can now be compiled and used from Python just like any other extension module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a compiled extension module\n",
    "You can also get f2py to both compile add.f along with the produced extension module leaving only a shared-library extension file that can be imported from Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "python -m numpy.f2py -c -m add add.f\n",
    "This command produces a Python extension module compatible with your platform. This module may then be imported from Python. It will contain a method for each subroutine in add. The docstring of each method contains information about how the module method may be called:\n",
    "\n",

    "Improving the basic interface\n",
    "The default interface is a very literal translation of the Fortran code into Python. The Fortran array arguments are converted to NumPy arrays and the integer argument should be mapped to a C integer. The interface will attempt to convert all arguments to their required types (and shapes) and issue an error if unsuccessful. However, because f2py knows nothing about the semantics of the arguments (such that C is an output and n should really match the array sizes), it is possible to abuse this function in ways that can cause Python to crash. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "add.zadd([1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [3, 4], 1000)\n",
    "will cause a program crash on most systems. Under the hood, the lists are being converted to arrays but then the underlying add function is told to cycle way beyond the borders of the allocated memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to improve the interface, f2py supports directives. This is accomplished by constructing a signature file. It is usually best to start from the interfaces that f2py produces in that file, which correspond to the default behavior. To get f2py to generate the interface file use the -h option:\n",
    "\n",
    "python -m numpy.f2py -h add.pyf -m add add.f\n",
    "This command creates the add.pyf file in the current directory. The section of this file corresponding to zadd is:\n",
    "\n",
    "subroutine zadd(a,b,c,n) ! in :add:add.f\n",
    "   double complex dimension(*) :: a\n",
    "   double complex dimension(*) :: b\n",
    "   double complex dimension(*) :: c\n",
    "   integer :: n\n",
    "end subroutine zadd\n",
    "By placing intent directives and checking code, the interface can be cleaned up quite a bit so the Python module method is both easier to use and more robust to malformed inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "subroutine zadd(a,b,c,n) ! in :add:add.f\n",
    "   double complex dimension(n) :: a\n",
    "   double complex dimension(n) :: b\n",
    "   double complex intent(out),dimension(n) :: c\n",
    "   integer intent(hide),depend(a) :: n=len(a)\n",
    "end subroutine zadd\n",
    "The intent directive, intent(out) is used to tell f2py that c is an output variable and should be created by the interface before being passed to the underlying code. The intent(hide) directive tells f2py to not allow the user to specify the variable, n, but instead to get it from the size of a. The depend( a ) directive is necessary to tell f2py that the value of n depends on the input a (so that it won’t try to create the variable n until the variable a is created).\n",
    "\n",
    "After modifying add.pyf, the new Python module file can be generated by compiling both add.f and add.pyf:\n",
    "\n",
    "python -m numpy.f2py -c add.pyf add.f\n",
    "The new interface’s docstring is:\n",
    "\n",
    "import add\n",

    "c = zadd(a,b)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Parameters\n",
    "----------\n",
    "a : input rank-1 array('D') with bounds (n)\n",
    "b : input rank-1 array('D') with bounds (n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns\n",
    "-------\n",
    "c : rank-1 array('D') with bounds (n)\n",
    "Now, the function can be called in a much more robust way:\n",
    "\n",
    "add.zadd([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\n",
    "array([5.+0.j, 7.+0.j, 9.+0.j])\n",
    "Notice the automatic conversion to the correct format that occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inserting directives in Fortran source\n",
    "The robust interface of the previous section can also be generated automatically by placing the variable directives as special comments in the original Fortran code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "For projects where the Fortran code is being actively developed, this may be preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if the source code is modified to contain:\n",

    "python -m numpy.f2py -c -m add add.f\n",
    "The resulting signature for the function add.zadd is exactly the same one that was created previously. If the original source code had contained A(N) instead of A(*) and so forth with B and C, then nearly the same interface can be obtained by placing the INTENT(OUT) :: C comment line in the source code.
