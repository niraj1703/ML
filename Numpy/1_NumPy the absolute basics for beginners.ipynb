    "Depending on the characteristics of the data and the types of operations that need to be performed, other containers may be more appropriate; by exploiting these characteristics, we can improve speed, reduce memory consumption, and offer a high-level syntax for performing a variety of common processing tasks. NumPy shines when there are large quantities of “homogeneous” (same-type) data to be processed on the CPU."

Essentially, C and Fortran orders have to do with how indices correspond to the order the array is stored in memory. In Fortran, when moving through the elements of a two-dimensional array as it is stored in memory, the first index is the most rapidly varying index. As the first index moves to the next row as it changes, the matrix is stored one column at a time. This is why Fortran is thought of as a Column-major language. In C on the other hand, the last index changes the most rapidly. The matrix is stored by rows, making it a Row-major language. What you do for C or Fortran depends on whether it’s more important to preserve the indexing convention or not reorder the data."

    "## Working with mathematical formulas\n",
    "The ease of implementing mathematical formulas that work on arrays is one of the things that make NumPy so widely used in the scientific Python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this is the mean square error formula (a central formula used in supervised machine learning models that deal with regression):\n",
    "\n",
    "../_images/np_MSE_formula.png\n",
    "Implementing this formula is simple and straightforward in NumPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "../_images/np_MSE_implementation.png\n",
    "What makes this work so well is that predictions and labels can contain one or a thousand values. They only need to be the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visualize it this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "../_images/np_mse_viz1.png\n",
    "In this example, both the predictions and labels vectors contain three values, meaning n has a value of three. After we carry out subtractions the values in the vector are squared. Then NumPy sums the values, and your result is the error value for that prediction and a score for the quality of the model.\n",

    "## How to save and load NumPy objects\n",
    "This section covers np.save, np.savez, np.savetxt, np.load, np.loadtxt\n",
    "\n",
    "You will, at some point, want to save your arrays to disk and load them back without having to re-run the code. Fortunately, there are several ways to save and load objects with NumPy. The ndarray objects can be saved to and loaded from the disk files with loadtxt and savetxt functions that handle normal text files, load and save functions that handle NumPy binary files with a .npy file extension, and a savez function that handles NumPy files with a .npz file extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The .npy and .npz files store data, shape, dtype, and other information required to reconstruct the ndarray in a way that allows the array to be correctly retrieved, even when the file is on another machine with different architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to store a single ndarray object, store it as a .npy file using np.save. If you want to store more than one ndarray object in a single file, save it as a .npz file using np.savez. You can also save several arrays into a single file in compressed npz format with savez_compressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s easy to save and load an array with np.save(). Just make sure to specify the array you want to save and a file name. For example, if you create this array:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n",
    "You can save it as “filename.npy” with:\n",
    "\n",
    "np.save('filename', a)\n",
    "You can use np.load() to reconstruct your array.\n",
    "\n",
    "b = np.load('filename.npy')\n",
    "If you want to check your array, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(b)\n",
    "[1 2 3 4 5 6]\n",
    "You can save a NumPy array as a plain text file like a .csv or .txt file with np.savetxt.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you create this array:\n",
    "\n",
    "csv_arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])\n",
    "You can easily save it as a .csv file with the name “new_file.csv” like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "np.savetxt('new_file.csv', csv_arr)\n",
    "You can quickly and easily load your saved text file using loadtxt():\n",
    "\n",
    "np.loadtxt('new_file.csv')\n",
    "array([1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8.])\n",
    "The savetxt() and loadtxt() functions accept additional optional parameters such as header, footer, and delimiter. While text files can be easier for sharing, .npy and .npz files are smaller and faster to read. If you need more sophisticated handling of your text file (for example, if you need to work with lines that contain missing values), you will want to use the genfromtxt function.\n",
    "\n",
    "With savetxt, you can specify headers, footers, comments, and more.\n",
