    "Using F2PY\n",
    "This page contains a reference to all command-line options for the f2py command, as well as a reference to internal functions of the numpy.f2py module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using f2py as a command-line tool\n",
    "When used as a command-line tool, f2py has three major modes, distinguished by the usage of -c and -h switches.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Signature file generation\n",
    "To scan Fortran sources and generate a signature file, use\n",
    "\n",
    "f2py -h <filename.pyf> <options> <fortran files>   \\\n",
    "  [[ only: <fortran functions>  : ]                \\\n",
    "    [ skip: <fortran functions>  : ]]...           \\\n",
    "  [<fortran files> ...]\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "A Fortran source file can contain many routines, and it is often not necessary to allow all routines to be usable from Python. In such cases, either specify which routines should be wrapped (in the only: .. : part) or which routines F2PY should ignore (in the skip: .. : part).\n",
    "\n",
    "F2PY has no concept of a “per-file” skip or only list, so if functions are listed in only, no other functions will be taken from any other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "If <filename.pyf> is specified as stdout, then signatures are written to standard output instead of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other options (see below), the following can be used in this mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "--overwrite-signature\n",
    "Overwrites an existing signature file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extension module construction\n",
    "To construct an extension module, use\n",
    "\n",
    "f2py -m <modulename> <options> <fortran files>   \\\n",
    "  [[ only: <fortran functions>  : ]              \\\n",
    "    [ skip: <fortran functions>  : ]]...          \\\n",
    "  [<fortran files> ...]\n",
    "The constructed extension module is saved as <modulename>module.c to the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here <fortran files> may also contain signature files. Among other options (see below), the following options can be used in this mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "--debug-capi\n",
    "Adds debugging hooks to the extension module. When using this extension module, various diagnostic information about the wrapper is written to the standard output, for example, the values of variables, the steps taken, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "-include'<includefile>'\n",
    "Add a CPP #include statement to the extension module source. <includefile> should be given in one of the following forms\n",
    "\n",
    "\"filename.ext\"\n",
    "<filename.ext>\n",
    "The include statement is inserted just before the wrapper functions. This feature enables using arbitrary C functions (defined in <includefile>) in F2PY generated wrappers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This option is deprecated. Use usercode statement to specify C code snippets directly in signature files.\n",
    "\n",
    "--[no-]wrap-functions\n",
    "Create Fortran subroutine wrappers to Fortran functions. --wrap-functions is default because it ensures maximum portability and compiler independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "--[no-]freethreading-compatible\n",
    "Create a module that declares it does or doesn’t require the GIL. The default is --no-freethreading-compatible for backwards compatibility. Inspect the fortran code you are wrapping for thread safety issues before passing --freethreading-compatible, as f2py does not analyze fortran code for thread safety issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "--include-paths \"<path1>:<path2>...\"\n",
    "Search include files from given directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The paths are to be separated by the correct operating system separator pathsep, that is : on Linux / MacOS and ; on Windows. In CMake this corresponds to using $<SEMICOLON>.\n",
    "\n",
    "--help-link [<list of resources names>]\n",
    "List system resources found by numpy_distutils/system_info.py. For example, try f2py --help-link lapack_opt.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Building a module\n",
    "To build an extension module, use\n",
    "\n",
    "f2py -c <options> <fortran files>       \\\n",
    "  [[ only: <fortran functions>  : ]     \\\n",
    "    [ skip: <fortran functions>  : ]]... \\\n",
    "  [ <fortran/c source files> ] [ <.o, .a, .so files> ]\n",
    "If <fortran files> contains a signature file, then the source for an extension module is constructed, all Fortran and C sources are compiled, and finally all object and library files are linked to the extension module <modulename>.so which is saved into the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If <fortran files> does not contain a signature file, then an extension module is constructed by scanning all Fortran source codes for routine signatures, before proceeding to build the extension module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "From Python 3.12 onwards, distutils has been removed. Use environment variables or native files to interact with meson instead. See its FAQ for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other options (see below) and options described for previous modes, the following can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Changed in version 1.26.0: There are now two separate build backends which can be used, distutils and meson. Users are strongly recommended to switch to meson since it is the default above Python 3.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common build flags:\n",
    "\n",
    "--backend <backend_type>\n",
    "Specify the build backend for the compilation process. The supported backends are meson and distutils. If not specified, defaults to distutils. On Python 3.12 or higher, the default is meson.\n",

    "\n",
    "The meson specific flags are:\n",
    "\n",
    "--dep <dependency> meson only\n",
    "Specify a meson dependency for the module. This may be passed multiple times for multiple dependencies. Dependencies are stored in a list for further processing. Example: --dep lapack --dep scalapack This will identify “lapack” and “scalapack” as dependencies and remove them from argv, leaving a dependencies list containing [“lapack”, “scalapack”].\n",
    "\n",
    "The older distutils flags are:\n",
    "\n",

    "link-<resource> no meson\n",
    "Link the extension module with <resource> as defined by numpy_distutils/system_info.py. E.g. to link with optimized LAPACK libraries (vecLib on MacOSX, ATLAS elsewhere), use --link-lapack_opt. See also --help-link switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The f2py -c option must be applied either to an existing .pyf file (plus the source/object/library files) or one must specify the -m <modulename> option (plus the sources/object/library files). Use one of the following options:\n",

    "\n",
    "-DPREPEND_FORTRAN\n",
    "-DNO_APPEND_FORTRAN\n",
    "-DUPPERCASE_FORTRAN\n",
    "To test the performance of F2PY generated interfaces, use -DF2PY_REPORT_ATEXIT. Then a report of various timings is printed out at the exit of Python. This feature may not work on all platforms, and currently only Linux is supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see whether F2PY generated interface performs copies of array arguments, use -DF2PY_REPORT_ON_ARRAY_COPY=<int>. When the size of an array argument is larger than <int>, a message about the copying is sent to stderr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other options\n",
    "-m <modulename>\n",
    "Name of an extension module. Default is untitled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t use this option if a signature file (*.pyf) is used.\n",

    "\n",
    "--[no-]lower\n",
    "Do [not] lower the cases in <fortran files>. By default, --lower is assumed with -h switch, and --no-lower without the -h switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "-include<header>\n",

    "Python module numpy.f2py\n",
    "Warning\n",
