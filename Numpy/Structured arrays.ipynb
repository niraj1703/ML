    "# Structured arrays\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Structured arrays are ndarrays whose datatype is a composition of simpler datatypes organized as a sequence of named fields. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "x = np.array([('Rex', 9, 81.0), ('Fido', 3, 27.0)],\n",
    "             dtype=[('name', 'U10'), ('age', 'i4'), ('weight', 'f4')])\n",
    "x\n",
    "array([('Rex', 9, 81.), ('Fido', 3, 27.)],\n",
    "      dtype=[('name', '<U10'), ('age', '<i4'), ('weight', '<f4')])\n",
    "Here x is a one-dimensional array of length two whose datatype is a structure with three fields: 1. A string of length 10 or less named ‘name’, 2. a 32-bit integer named ‘age’, and 3. a 32-bit float named ‘weight’.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you index x at position 1 you get a structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "x[1]\n",
    "np.void(('Fido', 3, 27.0), dtype=[('name', '<U10'), ('age', '<i4'), ('weight', '<f4')])\n",
    "You can access and modify individual fields of a structured array by indexing with the field name:\n",
    "\n",
    "x['age']\n",
    "array([9, 3], dtype=int32)\n",
    "x['age'] = 5\n",
    "x\n",
    "array([('Rex', 5, 81.), ('Fido', 5, 27.)],\n",
    "      dtype=[('name', '<U10'), ('age', '<i4'), ('weight', '<f4')])\n",
    "Structured datatypes are designed to be able to mimic ‘structs’ in the C language, and share a similar memory layout. They are meant for interfacing with C code and for low-level manipulation of structured buffers, for example for interpreting binary blobs. For these purposes they support specialized features such as subarrays, nested datatypes, and unions, and allow control over the memory layout of the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users looking to manipulate tabular data, such as stored in csv files, may find other pydata projects more suitable, such as xarray, pandas, or DataArray. These provide a high-level interface for tabular data analysis and are better optimized for that use. For instance, the C-struct-like memory layout of structured arrays in numpy can lead to poor cache behavior in comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structured datatypes\n",
    "A structured datatype can be thought of as a sequence of bytes of a certain length (the structure’s itemsize) which is interpreted as a collection of fields. Each field has a name, a datatype, and a byte offset within the structure. The datatype of a field may be any numpy datatype including other structured datatypes, and it may also be a subarray data type which behaves like an ndarray of a specified shape. The offsets of the fields are arbitrary, and fields may even overlap. These offsets are usually determined automatically by numpy, but can also be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structured datatype creation\n",
    "Structured datatypes may be created using the function numpy.dtype. There are 4 alternative forms of specification which vary in flexibility and conciseness. These are further documented in the Data Type Objects reference page, and in summary they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of tuples, one tuple per field\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tuple has the form (fieldname, datatype, shape) where shape is optional. fieldname is a string (or tuple if titles are used, see Field Titles below), datatype may be any object convertible to a datatype, and shape is a tuple of integers specifying subarray shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "np.dtype([('x', 'f4'), ('y', np.float32), ('z', 'f4', (2, 2))])\n",
    "dtype([('x', '<f4'), ('y', '<f4'), ('z', '<f4', (2, 2))])\n",
    "If fieldname is the empty string '', the field will be given a default name of the form f#, where # is the integer index of the field, counting from 0 from the left:\n",
    "\n",
    "np.dtype([('x', 'f4'), ('', 'i4'), ('z', 'i8')])\n",
    "dtype([('x', '<f4'), ('f1', '<i4'), ('z', '<i8')])\n",
    "The byte offsets of the fields within the structure and the total structure itemsize are determined automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string of comma-separated dtype specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "In this shorthand notation any of the string dtype specifications may be used in a string and separated by commas. The itemsize and byte offsets of the fields are determined automatically, and the field names are given the default names f0, f1, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "np.dtype('i8, f4, S3')\n",
    "dtype([('f0', '<i8'), ('f1', '<f4'), ('f2', 'S3')])\n",
    "np.dtype('3int8, float32, (2, 3)float64')\n",
    "dtype([('f0', 'i1', (3,)), ('f1', '<f4'), ('f2', '<f8', (2, 3))])\n",
    "A dictionary of field parameter arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most flexible form of specification since it allows control over the byte-offsets of the fields and the itemsize of the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary has two required keys, ‘names’ and ‘formats’, and four optional keys, ‘offsets’, ‘itemsize’, ‘aligned’ and ‘titles’. The values for ‘names’ and ‘formats’ should respectively be a list of field names and a list of dtype specifications, of the same length. The optional ‘offsets’ value should be a list of integer byte-offsets, one for each field within the structure. If ‘offsets’ is not given the offsets are determined automatically. The optional ‘itemsize’ value should be an integer describing the total size in bytes of the dtype, which must be large enough to contain all the fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "np.dtype({'names': ['col1', 'col2'], 'formats': ['i4', 'f4']})\n",
    "dtype([('col1', '<i4'), ('col2', '<f4')])\n",
    "np.dtype({'names': ['col1', 'col2'],\n",
    "          'formats': ['i4', 'f4'],\n",
    "          'offsets': [0, 4],\n",
    "          'itemsize': 12})\n",
    "dtype({'names': ['col1', 'col2'], 'formats': ['<i4', '<f4'], 'offsets': [0, 4], 'itemsize': 12})\n",
    "Offsets may be chosen such that the fields overlap, though this will mean that assigning to one field may clobber any overlapping field’s data. As an exception, fields of numpy.object_ type cannot overlap with other fields, because of the risk of clobbering the internal object pointer and then dereferencing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional ‘aligned’ value can be set to True to make the automatic offset computation use aligned offsets (see Automatic byte offsets and alignment), as if the ‘align’ keyword argument of numpy.dtype had been set to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional ‘titles’ value should be a list of titles of the same length as ‘names’, see Field Titles below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary of field names\n",
    "\n",
    "The keys of the dictionary are the field names and the values are tuples specifying type and offset:\n",
    "\n",
    "np.dtype({'col1': ('i1', 0), 'col2': ('f4', 1)})\n",
    "dtype([('col1', 'i1'), ('col2', '<f4')])\n",
    "This form was discouraged because Python dictionaries did not preserve order in Python versions before Python 3.6. Field Titles may be specified by using a 3-tuple, see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manipulating and displaying structured datatypes\n",
    "The list of field names of a structured datatype can be found in the names attribute of the dtype object:\n",
    "\n",
    "d = np.dtype([('x', 'i8'), ('y', 'f4')])\n",
    "d.names\n",
    "('x', 'y')\n",
    "The dtype of each individual field can be looked up by name:\n",
    "\n",
    "d['x']\n",
    "dtype('int64')\n",
    "The field names may be modified by assigning to the names attribute using a sequence of strings of the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dtype object also has a dictionary-like attribute, fields, whose keys are the field names (and Field Titles, see below) and whose values are tuples containing the dtype and byte offset of each field.\n",
    "\n",
    "d.fields\n",
    "mappingproxy({'x': (dtype('int64'), 0), 'y': (dtype('float32'), 8)})\n",
    "Both the names and fields attributes will equal None for unstructured arrays. The recommended way to test if a dtype is structured is with if dt.names is not None rather than if dt.names, to account for dtypes with 0 fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The string representation of a structured datatype is shown in the “list of tuples” form if possible, otherwise numpy falls back to using the more general dictionary form.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatic byte offsets and alignment\n",
    "Numpy uses one of two methods to automatically determine the field byte offsets and the overall itemsize of a structured datatype, depending on whether align=True was specified as a keyword argument to numpy.dtype.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default (align=False), numpy will pack the fields together such that each field starts at the byte offset the previous field ended, and the fields are contiguous in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_offsets(d):\n",
    "    print(\"offsets:\", [d.fields[name][1] for name in d.names])\n",
    "    print(\"itemsize:\", d.itemsize)\n",
    "print_offsets(np.dtype('u1, u1, i4, u1, i8, u2'))\n",
    "offsets: [0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 15]\n",
    "itemsize: 17\n",
    "If align=True is set, numpy will pad the structure in the same way many C compilers would pad a C-struct. Aligned structures can give a performance improvement in some cases, at the cost of increased datatype size. Padding bytes are inserted between fields such that each field’s byte offset will be a multiple of that field’s alignment, which is usually equal to the field’s size in bytes for simple datatypes, see PyArray_Descr.alignment. The structure will also have trailing padding added so that its itemsize is a multiple of the largest field’s alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "print_offsets(np.dtype('u1, u1, i4, u1, i8, u2', align=True))\n",
    "offsets: [0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 24]\n",
    "itemsize: 32\n",
    "Note that although almost all modern C compilers pad in this way by default, padding in C structs is C-implementation-dependent so this memory layout is not guaranteed to exactly match that of a corresponding struct in a C program. Some work may be needed, either on the numpy side or the C side, to obtain exact correspondence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If offsets were specified using the optional offsets key in the dictionary-based dtype specification, setting align=True will check that each field’s offset is a multiple of its size and that the itemsize is a multiple of the largest field size, and raise an exception if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the offsets of the fields and itemsize of a structured array satisfy the alignment conditions, the array will have the ALIGNED flag set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A convenience function numpy.lib.recfunctions.repack_fields converts an aligned dtype or array to a packed one and vice versa. It takes either a dtype or structured ndarray as an argument, and returns a copy with fields re-packed, with or without padding bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Field titles\n",
    "In addition to field names, fields may also have an associated title, an alternate name, which is sometimes used as an additional description or alias for the field. The title may be used to index an array, just like a field name.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add titles when using the list-of-tuples form of dtype specification, the field name may be specified as a tuple of two strings instead of a single string, which will be the field’s title and field name respectively. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "np.dtype([(('my title', 'name'), 'f4')])\n",
    "dtype([(('my title', 'name'), '<f4')])\n",
    "When using the first form of dictionary-based specification, the titles may be supplied as an extra 'titles' key as described above. When using the second (discouraged) dictionary-based specification, the title can be supplied by providing a 3-element tuple (datatype, offset, title) instead of the usual 2-element tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "np.dtype({'name': ('i4', 0, 'my title')})\n",
    "dtype([(('my title', 'name'), '<i4')])\n",
    "The dtype.fields dictionary will contain titles as keys, if any titles are used. This means effectively that a field with a title will be represented twice in the fields dictionary. The tuple values for these fields will also have a third element, the field title. Because of this, and because the names attribute preserves the field order while the fields attribute may not, it is recommended to iterate through the fields of a dtype using the names attribute of the dtype, which will not list titles, as in:\n",
    "\n",
    "for name in d.names:\n",
    "    print(d.fields[name][:2])\n",
    "(dtype('int64'), 0)\n",
    "(dtype('float32'), 8)\n",
    "## Union types\n",
    "Structured datatypes are implemented in numpy to have base type numpy.void by default, but it is possible to interpret other numpy types as structured types using the (base_dtype, dtype) form of dtype specification described in Data Type Objects. Here, base_dtype is the desired underlying dtype, and fields and flags will be copied from dtype. This dtype is similar to a ‘union’ in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Indexing and assignment to structured arrays\n",
    "## Assigning data to a structured array\n",
    "There are a number of ways to assign values to a structured array: Using python tuples, using scalar values, or using other structured arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment from Python Native Types (Tuples)\n",
    "The simplest way to assign values to a structured array is using python tuples. Each assigned value should be a tuple of length equal to the number of fields in the array, and not a list or array as these will trigger numpy’s broadcasting rules. The tuple’s elements are assigned to the successive fields of the array, from left to right:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Assignment from other Structured Arrays\n",
    "Assignment between two structured arrays occurs as if the source elements had been converted to tuples and then assigned to the destination elements. That is, the first field of the source array is assigned to the first field of the destination array, and the second field likewise, and so on, regardless of field names.
