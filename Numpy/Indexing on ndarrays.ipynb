    "# Indexing on ndarrays\n",
    "See also\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing routines\n",
    "\n",
    "ndarrays can be indexed using the standard Python x[obj] syntax, where x is the array and obj the selection. There are different kinds of indexing available depending on obj: basic indexing, advanced indexing and field access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the following examples show the use of indexing when referencing data in an array. The examples work just as well when assigning to an array. See Assigning values to indexed arrays for specific examples and explanations on how assignments work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in Python, x[(exp1, exp2, ..., expN)] is equivalent to x[exp1, exp2, ..., expN]; the latter is just syntactic sugar for the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single element indexing\n",
    "Single element indexing works exactly like that for other standard Python sequences. It is 0-based, and accepts negative indices for indexing from the end of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "x = np.arange(10)\n",
    "x[2]\n",
    "2\n",
    "x[-2]\n",
    "8\n",
    "It is not necessary to separate each dimension’s index into its own set of square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "x.shape = (2, 5)  # now x is 2-dimensional\n",
    "x[1, 3]\n",
    "8\n",
    "x[1, -1]\n",
    "9\n",
    "Note that if one indexes a multidimensional array with fewer indices than dimensions, one gets a subdimensional array. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x[0]\n",
    "array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "That is, each index specified selects the array corresponding to the rest of the dimensions selected. In the above example, choosing 0 means that the remaining dimension of length 5 is being left unspecified, and that what is returned is an array of that dimensionality and size. It must be noted that the returned array is a view, i.e., it is not a copy of the original, but points to the same values in memory as does the original array. In this case, the 1-D array at the first position (0) is returned. So using a single index on the returned array, results in a single element being returned. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "x[0][2]\n",
    "2\n",
    "So note that x[0, 2] == x[0][2] though the second case is more inefficient as a new temporary array is created after the first index that is subsequently indexed by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy uses C-order indexing. That means that the last index usually represents the most rapidly changing memory location, unlike Fortran or IDL, where the first index represents the most rapidly changing location in memory. This difference represents a great potential for confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slicing and striding\n",
    "Basic slicing extends Python’s basic concept of slicing to N dimensions. Basic slicing occurs when obj is a slice object (constructed by start:stop:step notation inside of brackets), an integer, or a tuple of slice objects and integers. Ellipsis and newaxis objects can be interspersed with these as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest case of indexing with N integers returns an array scalar representing the corresponding item. As in Python, all indices are zero-based: for the i-th index \n",
    ", the valid range is \n",
    " where \n",
    " is the i-th element of the shape of the array. Negative indices are interpreted as counting from the end of the array (i.e., if \n",
    ", it means \n",
    ").\n",
    "\n",
    "All arrays generated by basic slicing are always views of the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy slicing creates a view instead of a copy as in the case of built-in Python sequences such as string, tuple and list. Care must be taken when extracting a small portion from a large array which becomes useless after the extraction, because the small portion extracted contains a reference to the large original array whose memory will not be released until all arrays derived from it are garbage-collected. In such cases an explicit copy() is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard rules of sequence slicing apply to basic slicing on a per-dimension basis (including using a step index). Some useful concepts to remember include:\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic slice syntax is i:j:k where i is the starting index, j is the stopping index, and k is the step (\n",
    "). This selects the m elements (in the corresponding dimension) with index values i, i + k, …, i + (m - 1) k where \n",
    " and q and r are the quotient and remainder obtained by dividing j - i by k: j - i = q k + r, so that i + (m - 1) k < j. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n",
    "x[1:7:2]\n",
    "array([1, 3, 5])\n",
    "Negative i and j are interpreted as n + i and n + j where n is the number of elements in the corresponding dimension. Negative k makes stepping go towards smaller indices. From the above example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x[-2:10]\n",
    "array([8, 9])\n",
    "x[-3:3:-1]\n",
    "array([7, 6, 5, 4])\n",
    "Assume n is the number of elements in the dimension being sliced. Then, if i is not given it defaults to 0 for k > 0 and n - 1 for k < 0 . If j is not given it defaults to n for k > 0 and -n-1 for k < 0 . If k is not given it defaults to 1. Note that :: is the same as : and means select all indices along this axis. From the above example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x[5:]\n",
    "array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n",
    "If the number of objects in the selection tuple is less than N, then : is assumed for any subsequent dimensions. For example:\n",

    "x = np.array([[[1],[2],[3]], [[4],[5],[6]]])\n",
    "x.shape\n",
    "(2, 3, 1)\n",
    "x[1:2]\n",
    "array([[[4],\n",
    "        [5],\n",
    "        [6]]])\n",
    "An integer, i, returns the same values as i:i+1 except the dimensionality of the returned object is reduced by 1. In particular, a selection tuple with the p-th element an integer (and all other entries :) returns the corresponding sub-array with dimension N - 1. If N = 1 then the returned object is an array scalar. These objects are explained in Scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the selection tuple has all entries : except the p-th entry which is a slice object i:j:k, then the returned array has dimension N formed by stacking, along the p-th axis, the sub-arrays returned by integer indexing of elements i, i+k, …, i + (m - 1) k < j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic slicing with more than one non-: entry in the slicing tuple, acts like repeated application of slicing using a single non-: entry, where the non-: entries are successively taken (with all other non-: entries replaced by :). Thus, x[ind1, ..., ind2,:] acts like x[ind1][..., ind2, :] under basic slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Warning__\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is not true for advanced indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use slicing to set values in the array, but (unlike lists) you can never grow the array. The size of the value to be set in x[obj] = value must be (broadcastable to) the same shape as x[obj].\n",
    "\n",
    "A slicing tuple can always be constructed as obj and used in the x[obj] notation. Slice objects can be used in the construction in place of the [start:stop:step] notation. For example, x[1:10:5, ::-1] can also be implemented as obj = (slice(1, 10, 5), slice(None, None, -1)); x[obj] . This can be useful for constructing generic code that works on arrays of arbitrary dimensions. See Dealing with variable numbers of indices within programs for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dimensional indexing tools\n",
    "There are some tools to facilitate the easy matching of array shapes with expressions and in assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ellipsis expands to the number of : objects needed for the selection tuple to index all dimensions. In most cases, this means that the length of the expanded selection tuple is x.ndim. There may only be a single ellipsis present. From the above example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x[..., 0]\n",
    "array([[1, 2, 3],\n",
    "      [4, 5, 6]])\n",

    "\n",
    "x[:, :, 0]\n",
    "array([[1, 2, 3],\n",
    "      [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "Each newaxis object in the selection tuple serves to expand the dimensions of the resulting selection by one unit-length dimension. The added dimension is the position of the newaxis object in the selection tuple. newaxis is an alias for None, and None can be used in place of this with the same result. From the above example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x[:, np.newaxis, :, :].shape\n",
    "(2, 1, 3, 1)\n",
    "x[:, None, :, :].shape\n",
    "(2, 1, 3, 1)\n",
    "This can be handy to combine two arrays in a way that otherwise would require explicit reshaping operations. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = np.arange(5)\n",
    "x[:, np.newaxis] + x[np.newaxis, :]\n",
    "array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n",

    "      [3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n",
    "      [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]])\n",
    "## Advanced indexing\n",
    "Advanced indexing is triggered when the selection object, obj, is a non-tuple sequence object, an ndarray (of data type integer or bool), or a tuple with at least one sequence object or ndarray (of data type integer or bool). There are two types of advanced indexing: integer and Boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced indexing always returns a copy of the data (contrast with basic slicing that returns a view).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Warning__\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of advanced indexing means that x[(1, 2, 3),] is fundamentally different than x[(1, 2, 3)]. The latter is equivalent to x[1, 2, 3] which will trigger basic selection while the former will trigger advanced indexing. Be sure to understand why this occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integer array indexing\n",
    "Integer array indexing allows selection of arbitrary items in the array based on their N-dimensional index. Each integer array represents a number of indices into that dimension.\n",

    "## Combining advanced and basic indexing\n",
    "When there is at least one slice (:), ellipsis (...) or newaxis in the index (or the array has more dimensions than there are advanced indices), then the behaviour can be more complicated. It is like concatenating the indexing result for each advanced index element.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, there is only a single advanced index combined with a slice. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "y = np.arange(35).reshape(5,7)\n",

    "       [29, 30]])\n",
    "In effect, the slice and index array operation are independent. The slice operation extracts columns with index 1 and 2, (i.e. the 2nd and 3rd columns), followed by the index array operation which extracts rows with index 0, 2 and 4 (i.e the first, third and fifth rows). This is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "y[:, 1:3][np.array([0, 2, 4]), :]\n",
    "array([[ 1,  2],\n",
    "       [15, 16],\n",
    "       [29, 30]])\n",
    "A single advanced index can, for example, replace a slice and the result array will be the same. However, it is a copy and may have a different memory layout. A slice is preferable when it is possible. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = np.array([[ 0,  1,  2],\n",
    "              [ 3,  4,  5],\n",

    "array([[4, 5]])\n",
    "x[1:2, [1, 2]]\n",
    "array([[4, 5]])\n",
    "The easiest way to understand a combination of multiple advanced indices may be to think in terms of the resulting shape. There are two parts to the indexing operation, the subspace defined by the basic indexing (excluding integers) and the subspace from the advanced indexing part. Two cases of index combination need to be distinguished:\n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced indices are separated by a slice, Ellipsis or newaxis. For example x[arr1, :, arr2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced indices are all next to each other. For example x[..., arr1, arr2, :] but not x[arr1, :, 1] since 1 is an advanced index in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, the dimensions resulting from the advanced indexing operation come first in the result array, and the subspace dimensions after that. In the second case, the dimensions from the advanced indexing operations are inserted into the result array at the same spot as they were in the initial array (the latter logic is what makes simple advanced indexing behave just like slicing).\n",

    "__Example__\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose x.shape is (10, 20, 30) and ind is a (2, 5, 2)-shaped indexing intp array, then result = x[..., ind, :] has shape (10, 2, 5, 2, 30) because the (20,)-shaped subspace has been replaced with a (2, 5, 2)-shaped broadcasted indexing subspace. If we let i, j, k loop over the (2, 5, 2)-shaped subspace then result[..., i, j, k, :] = x[..., ind[i, j, k], :]. This example produces the same result as x.take(ind, axis=-2).\n",

However, x[:, ind_1, :, ind_2] has shape (2, 3, 4, 10, 30, 50) because there is no unambiguous place to drop in the indexing subspace, thus it is tacked-on to the beginning.

In older versions of NumPy, it returned a copy. See the user guide section on Structured arrays for more information on multifield indexing.\n",

    "x.flat returns an iterator that will iterate over the entire array (in C-contiguous style with the last index varying the fastest). This iterator object can also be indexed using basic slicing or advanced indexing as long as the selection object is not a tuple. This should be clear from the fact that x.flat is a 1-dimensional view. It can be used for integer indexing with 1-dimensional C-style-flat indices. The shape of any returned array is therefore the shape of the integer indexing object.\n",

    "## Assigning values to indexed arrays\n",
    "As mentioned, one can select a subset of an array to assign to using a single index, slices, and index and mask arrays. The value being assigned to the indexed array must be shape consistent (the same shape or broadcastable to the shape the index produces). For example, it is permitted to assign a constant to a slice:\n",

    "Where people expect that the 1st location will be incremented by 3. In fact, it will only be incremented by 1. The reason is that a new array is extracted from the original (as a temporary) containing the values at 1, 1, 3, 1, then the value 1 is added to the temporary, and then the temporary is assigned back to the original array. Thus the value of the array at x[1] + 1 is assigned to x[1] three times, rather than being incremented 3 times.\n",

    "## Dealing with variable numbers of indices within programs\n",
    "The indexing syntax is very powerful but limiting when dealing with a variable number of indices. For example, if you want to write a function that can handle arguments with various numbers of dimensions without having to write special case code for each number of possible dimensions, how can that be done? If one supplies to the index a tuple, the tuple will be interpreted as a list of indices. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "indices = (1, 1, 1, slice(0, 2))  # same as [1, 1, 1, 0:2]\n",
    "z[indices]\n",
    "array([39, 40])\n",
    "Likewise, ellipsis can be specified by code by using the Ellipsis object:\n",
    "\n",
    "indices = (1, Ellipsis, 1)  # same as [1, ..., 1]\n",
    "z[indices]\n",

    "## Detailed notes\n",
    "These are some detailed notes, which are not of importance for day to day indexing (in no particular order):\n",
    "\n",
    "The native NumPy indexing type is intp and may differ from the default integer array type. intp is the smallest data type sufficient to safely index any array; for advanced indexing it may be faster than other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "For advanced assignments, there is in general no guarantee for the iteration order. This means that if an element is set more than once, it is not possible to predict the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "An empty (tuple) index is a full scalar index into a zero-dimensional array. x[()] returns a scalar if x is zero-dimensional and a view otherwise. On the other hand, x[...] always returns a view.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a zero-dimensional array is present in the index and it is a full integer index the result will be a scalar and not a zero-dimensional array. (Advanced indexing is not triggered.)\n",
    "\n",
    "When an ellipsis (...) is present but has no size (i.e. replaces zero :) the result will still always be an array. A view if no advanced index is present, otherwise a copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonzero equivalence for Boolean arrays does not hold for zero dimensional boolean arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the result of an advanced indexing operation has no elements but an individual index is out of bounds, whether or not an IndexError is raised is undefined (e.g. x[[], [123]] with 123 being out of bounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a casting error occurs during assignment (for example updating a numerical array using a sequence of strings), the array being assigned to may end up in an unpredictable partially updated state. However, if any other error (such as an out of bounds index) occurs, the array will remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory layout of an advanced indexing result is optimized for each indexing operation and no particular memory order can be assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a subclass (especially one which manipulates its shape), the default ndarray.__setitem__ behaviour will call __getitem__ for basic indexing but not for advanced indexing. For such a subclass it may be preferable to call ndarray.__setitem__ with a base class ndarray view on the data. This must be done if the subclasses __getitem__ does not return views."
