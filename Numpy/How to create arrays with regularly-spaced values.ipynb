    "# How to create arrays with regularly-spaced values\n",
    "There are a few NumPy functions that are similar in application, but which provide slightly different results, which may cause confusion if one is not sure when and how to use them. The following guide aims to list these functions and describe their recommended usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions mentioned here are\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy.linspace\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy.arange\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy.geomspace\n",

    "## 1D domains (intervals)\n",
    "linspace vs. arange\n",
    "Both numpy.linspace and numpy.arange provide ways to partition an interval (a 1D domain) into equal-length subintervals. These partitions will vary depending on the chosen starting and ending points, and the step (the length of the subintervals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use numpy.arange if you want integer steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy.arange relies on step size to determine how many elements are in the returned array, which excludes the endpoint. This is determined through the step argument to arange.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "np.arange(0, 10, 2)  # np.arange(start, stop, step)\n",
    "array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8])\n",
    "The arguments start and stop should be integer or real, but not complex numbers. numpy.arange is similar to the Python built-in range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating-point inaccuracies can make arange results with floating-point numbers confusing. In this case, you should use numpy.linspace instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use numpy.linspace if you want the endpoint to be included in the result, or if you are using a non-integer step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy.linspace can include the endpoint and determines step size from the num argument, which specifies the number of elements in the returned array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of the endpoint is determined by an optional boolean argument endpoint, which defaults to True. Note that selecting endpoint=False will change the step size computation, and the subsequent output for the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "np.linspace(0.1, 0.2, num=5)  # np.linspace(start, stop, num)\n",
    "array([0.1  , 0.125, 0.15 , 0.175, 0.2  ])\n",
    "np.linspace(0.1, 0.2, num=5, endpoint=False)\n",
    "array([0.1, 0.12, 0.14, 0.16, 0.18])\n",
    "numpy.linspace can also be used with complex arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "np.linspace(1+1.j, 4, 5, dtype=np.complex64)\n",
    "array([1.  +1.j  , 1.75+0.75j, 2.5 +0.5j , 3.25+0.25j, 4.  +0.j  ],\n",
    "      dtype=complex64)\n",
    "## Other examples\n",
    "Unexpected results may happen if floating point values are used as step in numpy.arange. To avoid this, make sure all floating point conversion happens after the computation of results. For example, replace\n",

    "These differ because of numeric noise. When using floating point values, it is possible that 0 + 0.04 * 28 < 1.12, and so 1.12 is in the interval. In fact, this is exactly the case:\n",

    "array([2.        , 2.21336384, 2.44948974, 2.71080601, 3.        ])\n",

    "In linear space, the sequence starts at base ** start (base to the power of start) and ends with base ** stop:\n",

    "N-D domains can be partitioned into grids. This can be done using one of the following functions.\n",
